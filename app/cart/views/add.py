        # how this endpoint works:
        # the old way was that the client would send a list of product ids. we find the corresponding entity (store course section, membership program, books or vegetables for that matter) from that list of product ids. we do that to exclude any product id that does not have a correspoding entity (yes, a particular product id may not have a corresponding entity) and to apply different eligibility rules (e.g. is the section marked enrollment_ready or is the membership program is available during the current date etc).

        # but now that the client will send in entity identification information (section external_id, course external_id etc) directly, instead of first converting them to product ids and then converting them to corresponding entities, we can directly use the corresponding entity ids.

        # but that will break backward compatibility. so, we will have to do one thing twice. here's what the flow will look like now:
        # 1. get the entity ids and convert them to entities (store_course_section, membership_program etc)
        # 2. get the products from those entities
        # 3. convert them again to entities to check availability etc
        # 4. the rest
        #
        # this is is suppose not the best way to do it.
